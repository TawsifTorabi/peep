# peep
peep is a repository collecting all my discrete snippets of html, css, javascript to share with you.</br>
From these, I'm sure you might get one that you might need.</br>
I've been interested in web design and development since I was a teenage kid. I like working with web-techs.</br> 
Since then, I've wrote a lot of code snippets. </br>
From now, I'll be sharing it with you guys.
